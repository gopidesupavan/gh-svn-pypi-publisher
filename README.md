# gh-svn-pypi-publisher

**`gh-svn-pypi-publisher`** is a composite action repository used to validate artifacts and publish to PyPI from SVN.

## Composite Actions Used in This Repo

### read-config
This action reads the release configuration file and writes output to `GITHUB_OUTPUTS`. The configuration file is a YAML file containing rules to validate and config for the publish process.

**Example configuration file:**

```yaml
project:
  name: example-project
  description: "Example project for publishing to PyPI"
publisher:
  name: providers
  url: "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow"
  path: "providers/"
checks:
  svn:
    - id: extension
      description: "Validate svn package extensions"
      identifiers:
        - type: regex
          pattern: ".*(py3-none-any.whl|tar.gz.sha512|tar.gz.asc|tar.gz|py3-none-any.whl.asc|py3-none-any.whl.sha512)$"

    - id: package_name
      description: "Validate svn package names"
      identifiers:
        - type: regex
          pattern: ".*(apache_airflow.*)$"

        - type: regex
          pattern: ".*(apache-airflow.*)$"

  checksum:
    - id: checksum
      description: "Validate check sum with SHA512"
      algorithm: "sha512"

  signature:
    - id: signature
      description: "Validate signatures with GPG of packages"
      method: gpg
      keys: "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS"

  publish:
    id: publish
    description: "Publish provider packages to PyPI"
    release-type: "RC_VERSION"
    exclude_extensions:
      - type: regex
        pattern: ".*(.asc|.sha512)$"
    compare:
      url: "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/"
      path: "providers/"
      package_names:
        - type: regex
          pattern: "(apache_airflow_providers.*?)(?=rc)"
```
#### Publisher
This section contains the publisher details like `name`, `url`, and `path` to identify the repository in SVN.

- **`name`**: Configure any name for the publisher. A meaningful name is recommended. For example, if you are releasing providers, you can name it `providers`.
- **`url`**: URL of the SVN repository to checkout.
- **`path`**: Path to the directory where the artifacts are stored in the SVN repository.

**Example**:  
If you want to release providers, and the SVN repository structure is as follows:
- `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/providers`
- `https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/providers`

To publish the packages from the `dev/providers` folder, set `url` and `path` in the `release-config.yml` as shown below:

```yaml
url: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow
repo-path: providers/
```
### INIT Action
This action is used to checkout the SVN repository to a temporary directory in the runner.  
It uses the configuration from the `read-config` action to checkout the repository.

**Inputs to the action**:
- **`temp-dir`**: Temporary directory to checkout the repository.
- **`repo-url`**: URL of the SVN repository to checkout.
- **`repo-path`**: Path to the directory where the artifacts are stored in the SVN repository.

### SVN Action
Action to validate the file name patterns and extensions of the artifacts in the SVN repository.

This action uses the `svn` section from the `release-config.yml` to validate the artifacts. An example configuration is shown below.

```yaml
checks:
  svn:
    - id: extension
      description: "Validate svn package extensions"
      identifiers:
        - type: regex
          pattern: ".*(py3-none-any.whl|tar.gz.sha512|tar.gz.asc|tar.gz|py3-none-any.whl.asc|py3-none-any.whl.sha512)$"

    - id: package_name
      description: "Validate svn package names"
      identifiers:
        - type: regex
          pattern: ".*(apache_airflow.*)$"

        - type: regex
          pattern: ".*(apache-airflow.*)$"
```
#### Extension  
This rule is used to validate the package extension.  
It checks whether each package has the required extension or not. Examples include:

- `.tar.gz`  
- `.tar.gz.asc`  
- `.tar.gz.sha512`  
- `-py3-none-any.whl`  
- `-py3-none-any.whl.asc`  
- `-py3-none-any.whl.sha512`  

---

#### Package Name  
This rule is used to validate the package name.  
It checks whether each package name matches the required pattern or not.

At present, the **SVN Action** supports **only regex type identifiers** to validate the package names and extensions.

### Checksum Action
Action to validate the checksum of the artifacts in the SVN repository.

This action uses the `checksum` section from the `release-config.yml` to validate the artifacts. An example configuration is shown below.

```yaml
checks:
  checksum:
    - id: checksum
      description: "Validate check sum with SHA512"
      algorithm: "sha512"
```
#### Checksum
This rule is used to validate the checksum of the artifacts.

It checks the checksum of the artifacts with the provided checksum type.

Provide the checksum type in the `algorithm` field. eg: you may provide `sha512` or `sha256` as the checksum type. anything that is supported by the `hashlib` module in Python.

### Signature Action
Action to validate the signature of the artifacts in the SVN repository.

This action uses the `signature` section from the `release-config.yml` to validate the artifacts. An example configuration is shown below.

```yaml
checks:
  signature:
    - id: signature
      description: "Validate signatures with GPG of packages"
      method: gpg
      keys: "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/KEYS"
```
#### Signature
This rule is used to validate the signature of the artifacts.

It checks the signature of the artifacts with the provided GPG keys file in the `keys` field.

At present, the **Signature Action** supports **only GPG type identifiers** to validate the signature of the artifacts.

### Publish Action
Action to publish the artifacts to PyPI.

This action uses the `publish` section from the `release-config.yml` to publish the artifacts. An example configuration is shown below.

```yaml
checks:
  publish:
    id: publish
    description: "Publish provider packages to PyPI"
    release-type: "RC_VERSION"
    exclude_extensions:
      - type: regex
        pattern: ".*(.asc|.sha512)$"
    compare:
      url: "https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/release/airflow/"
      path: "providers/"
      package_names:
       - type: regex
         pattern: "(apache_airflow_providers.*?)(?=rc)"
```
#### Release Configuration
The `release-type` and `compare` sections are part of the validation and publishing configuration.

##### `release-type`
- **`RC_VERSION`**:  
  It will consider packages from the `dev/` folder and publish to PyPI.  

- **`PYPI_VERSION`**:  
  It will consider packages from the `release/` folder and publish to PyPI.

---

#### `compare`
This section contains the release svn folder configuration, 
it compares the packages in the `dev/` folder with release folder and only matching packages will be published to PyPI.

## Example Workflow
A sample github workflow file to use the composite actions is shown below:

```yaml
name: Tes gh-svn-pypi-publisher
description: "Publish to PyPI"

  workflow_dispatch:
    inputs:
      release-config:
        description: "Path to the release config file"
        required: true
        default: "release-config.yml"
      temp-dir:
        description: >
          Checkout directory of svn repo, this is used to checkout the svn repo.
        required: false
        default: "asf-dist"
      mode:
        description: "Mode to run the action"
        required: false
        default: "VERIFY"

  publish-to-pypi:
    name: Publish svn packages to PyPI
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    needs:
      - release-checks
    environment:
      name: test
    permissions:
      id-token: write  # IMPORTANT: mandatory for trusted publishing

    steps:
      - name: "Download release distributions for ${{ needs.release-checks.outputs.publisher-name }}"
        uses: actions/download-artifact@v4

        if: inputs.mode == 'RELEASE'
        with:
          packages-dir: "./dist"
```

The `mode` input is used to run the action in different modes.
- **`VERIFY`**:  
  It will only validate the artifacts and not publish to PyPI.

- **`RELEASE`**:  
    It will validate the artifacts and publish to PyPI.
