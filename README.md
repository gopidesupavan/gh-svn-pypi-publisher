# About publish-config.yml

The `publish-config.yml` file has composed of multiple rules to validate the artifacts and publish them to PyPI. The configuration file is structured as follows:

```yaml
project:
    Name: example-pub
    Description: Example project for publishing to PyPI

publishers:
    name: providers
    url: https://dist.apache.org/repos/dist/dev/airflow/
    path: "airflow/providers/pypi"
    version_pattern: '^(.*?)-(rc\d+-)?\d+'
    extensions:
      - .tar.gz
      - .tar.gz.asc
      - .tar.gz.sha512
      - -py3-none-any.whl
      - -py3-none-any.whl.asc
      - -py3-none-any.whl.sha512
    rules:
      svn-check:
          name: "SVN Check"
          type: "svn"
          enabled: "false"
      checksum-check:
          name: "SHA512 Check"
          type: "512"
          enabled: "true"
          script: "/home/runner/work/example-pub/example-pub/scripts/checksum_check.sh"
```
svn-check: This rule is used to validate the package extension. It checks each package have the required extension or not. eg: .tar.gz, .tar.gz.asc, .tar.gz.sha512, -py3-none-any.whl, -py3-none-any.whl.asc, -py3-none-any.whl.sha512, total 6 extensions are required. 

checksum-check: This rule is used to validate the checksum of the package. It checks the checksum of the package with the provided checksum type. eg: SHA512 checksum is required for each package.

script: Script use to validate the rules. if there is no script provided in the publish-config.yml file, the default script will be used to validate the rules. default scripts are under the src/scripts directory.
